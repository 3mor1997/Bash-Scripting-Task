# Bash-Scripting-Task
**Write a batch script to do the following tasks:**
1. Display the UID and username of the user executing the script.
2. Test if the last command succeeded and display a message to indicate the status.
3. Display if the user is the root user or not.
4. Check if the logged in user matches the user yaman (use string test conditional).
5. Create 3 users by using a for loop (where each iteration will ask for USERNAME,
EXPIRATION_DAYE, and ROLE of the user)
